- ‚úÖ **Your contact information** (phone, email, address)
- ‚úÖ **Your business hours** (Monday-Friday 8AM-6PM)
- ‚úÖ **Your services** (gutter guard installation & maintenance)
- ‚úÖ **Your geographic coordinates** (for precise local targeting)

## üìä EXPECTED SEO IMPROVEMENTS

### Week 1-2:
- Google crawls and indexes the new schema
