# ðŸš€ UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS - SITEMAP.XML

## CRITICAL: Upload This File to Fix Google Search Console

### What to Upload
**File**: `sitemap.xml` (located in this folder)
**Destination**: Your website's root directory

### Where to Upload
Upload `sitemap.xml` to the same location as your main website files, so it's accessible at:
`https://atlantagutterguardpros.com/sitemap.xml`

### How to Upload (Choose Your Method)

#### Method 1: FTP/SFTP Client
1. Open your FTP client (FileZilla, WinSCP, etc.)
2. Connect to your web server
3. Navigate to your website's root directory (usually `public_html` or `www`)
4. Upload `sitemap.xml` to the root directory
5. Verify it's accessible at https://atlantagutterguardpros.com/sitemap.xml

#### Method 2: Web Hosting Control Panel
1. Log into your hosting provider's control panel (cPanel, Plesk, etc.)
2. Go to File Manager
3. Navigate to your website's root directory
4. Upload `sitemap.xml`
5. Test the URL

#### Method 3: Website CMS/Admin Panel
If your website has a content management system:
1. Log into your website admin
2. Look for file upload or media manager
3. Upload `sitemap.xml` to the root directory

### âœ… How to Verify Upload Worked
1. Visit: https://atlantagutterguardpros.com/sitemap.xml
2. You should see XML code starting with: `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`
3. **NOT** your regular website homepage

### ðŸš¨ Current Problem
Right now, https://atlantagutterguardpros.com/sitemap.xml shows your homepage HTML instead of the XML sitemap. This blocks Google Search Console submission.

### âœ… After Upload Success
Once uploaded correctly, you can immediately:
1. Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
2. Request indexing for your pages
3. Start receiving organic search traffic

### Need Help?
- Contact your web developer
- Ask your hosting provider for assistance
- Use the automated monitoring tools in this folder to verify success

**This is the only blocking issue preventing Google Search Console submission!**
